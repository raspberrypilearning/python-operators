Operators are used in Python to perform operations on variables and values.

Here are some of the basic operators you can use in your Python projects:

### Arithmetic operators

Python's arithmetic operators perform common mathematical operations.

### Assignment operators

Python's assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

### Comparison operators

Python's comparison operators are used to compare two values, and are commonly used with conditional or `if` statements.

![A table showing the following comparison operators: == compares two values to see if they are equal; != compares two values to see if the are not equal; < compares two values to see if one is less than another; > compares two values to see if one is greater than another; >= compares two values to see if one is greater than or equal to another; < = compares values to see if one is less than or equal to another.](images/comparison_operators.png)
