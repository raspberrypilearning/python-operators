subtraction

multiplication

division

floor division

exponentiation

modulus

x / y (answer can be in floating point eg. 3.7)

x // y (answer is an integer removing the decimals eg. 3)

x ** y (x to the power of y)

x % y (answer gives the remainder after x is divided by y)

Assigns a value a variable is equal to

Adds a value to the variable

Subtracts a value from the variable

Multiplies a value by the variable

Divides a value from the variable

x += 2 is the same as x = x + 2

x -= 2 is the same as x = x - 2

x *= 2 is the same as x = x * 2

x /= 2 is the same as x = x / 2

Compares two values to see if they are equal

Compares two values to see if they are not equal

Compares two values to see if one is greater than another

Compares two values to see if one is less than another

Compares two values to see if one is greater than or equal to another

Compares two values to see if one is less than or equal to another
